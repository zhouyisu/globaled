## When we think of elite schools

## Today's global elite schools have their origin in UK's boarding school model

### Products of globalization: Complicated network of elite schools

Anthropologists Jane Kenway and a team of researchers tracked six oldest elite schools around the world: 

- Australia (est 1866)
- Barbados (est 1820s)
- Hong Kong (est 1843)
- India (est 1882)
- Singapore (est 1823)
- South Africa (est 1870)

---

## Origin
.violet[Many of today's global elite schools have their origin in UK's boarding school model:]
- Established in 18th century
- Initially enrolled only boys, no girls
- Operated by different people and organizations: priests 教士, royal charter 皇室特許, charities 慈善機構, merchants 商人, etc)

.violet[Purpose:]
- Prepare the young sons of the rich and privileged families for the future: .orange[clergy] 牧師、教士, .orange[civil service], .orange[law or the armed services]
- Prepare them for _the Grand Tour_ 遊學旅行 to make economic and social connections with foreign peers: _social capital is key for elite class, as is always the case._

---
## What do they teach?
Surprisingly very little academics:

&gt;Studies of the schools in the eighteenth century vividly depict their archaic practices. They point to the schools' almost .violet[non-existent teaching] and their .violet[laissez-faire] approach to curriculum and internal governance. Boys ranged freely beyond the school, their itineraries included fishing, hunting, even poaching the local alehouse and liaisons with village girls. (Kenway et al., 2017, p. 24)

.footnote[archaic: 陳舊的; laissez-faire: 放任自由; poaching 偷獵; alehouse 酒窖 ]

---

## Into 19th century

Many prominent people pointed to the chaotic nature of school culture and ask: if the boys cannot govern themselves, how are they govern others?:

&gt;Very different school cultures emerged over the nineteenth century as the schools adapted their practices to suit these demands. They became much more .violet[focused], .violet[formal] and .violet[regimented]. It was over the nineteenth century as a whole that their identity and modus operandi 慣用做法 evolved from the disarray just described to that which is still recognizable, although not totally replicated, today. (Kenway et al., 2017, p. 24)

Not surprisingly, 19th century is when public education system emerged in Europe: 1800-1864 witness the emergence of an entire England school system. 


.footnote[regimented 嚴格管理; modus operandi 慣用做法 ]

## Elite schools became more like they are today

To differentiate itself from public education, elite schools developed certain characteristics:

__Social characteristics:__
- Not connected to local community
- Closed &amp; exclusive 不對外開放
- Hierarchical

__Educational characteristics:__
- .violet[Discipline] (i.e. corporal punishment)
- Focus on .violet[group loyalties]
- Prioritize .violet[athleticism] (i.e. sports)
- Learn the .violet[classics] (i.e. Greek and Latin)
- .violet[Not so much] science, technology, or modern language

---
class: reverse, center, middle

## Usefulness has never a focus of elite schools
- They did not aim to train their graduates to be the working class.
- Employable skills and knowledge were out of the question.

---

## What does globalization bring to elite schools?
As the British empire expands around the world, new clients emerged:
- The .violet[gentry] 士紳 and .violet[nobleman] 貴族 class were vanishing
- Emerging .violet[upper class] (i.e. the capitalists) with money want to use this institution as a channel to help their children secure a spot in the .violet[establishment] &lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.

New customers brought new demand:
- Science &amp; technology
- Entrepreneurship
- Proper education for girls
- Global consciousness


.footnote[
[1] Establishment is often translated as 建制 in Chinese. It literally really means ".brown[an established order of society"] ]

---
## Elite school to co-opt new clients

&gt; One of the landed gentry's class strategies was to co-opt those at the so-called .violet[top of the middle class—the wealthy industrialists with social aspirations],— those .violet[who had the wealth but not the social connections, cache or style]. 
&gt; 
&gt; This group was expected to rise to the occasion by aping their betters'—and they did. Seeking to .violet[live graciously]', ownership of country houses helped, but public school education was also a high-class hallmark. There was an increased demand for school education by the emerging middle class as a whole—many going into the expanding bureaucracy and, when possible, using the schools to gain a leg up. (Kenway et al., 2017, p. 36)

.green[Those upper middle class used to send their children to public schools. But now since everyone was going to the public schools, they wanted something to differentiate themselves from the rest.]

.footnote[landed gentry: 擁有土地的士紳階層; co-opt: 拉攏
]

---

## The ultimate goal is elite status, not so much education

&gt;But members of the wealthiest fraction wanted the sort of education that would help them and their offspring become accepted by the landed gentry and the aristocrats of the ".violet[old society]". 


&gt;By the middle of the nineteenth century, the public schools had become central in forging new class connections and rejections as the landed and the leaders of industry joined forces—the former reluctantly but expediently. (Kenway et al., 2017, p. 36)

### Example: Breakers (Rhode Island, USA) by the Vanderbilts

![:wscale 90%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/The_Breakers_Newport.jpg/1200px-The_Breakers_Newport.jpg)

As the richest man in the USA, Cornelius Vanderbilt II sent his sons &amp; daughters to England for boarding school.

## Offer new product: Curriculum

In the past, elite class monopolize top of the social strata though inheritance 继承 (i.e. money, fame, social status, cultural habit). 

They still do today, but they also need "merit" which could obtained via getting achievement in education. With the help of school curriclum such as .cyan[International Baccalaureate] (IB) and .cyan[Cambridge International Examinations] (CIE):

&gt;These programmes do not quite reject curricula that have a subject-based approach to knowledge but claim to also encourage .violet[problem-solving], .violet[creative] and .violet[critical thinking] and .violet[inter-disciplinarity] 跨學科 attributes thought to be necessary for negotiating global shifts in ways that are flexible. (Kenway et al., 2017, p. 149)

__From a social mobility perspective: is it contested or sponsored mobility?__

---

### Reinventing elite schools

Same belief, different take:
&gt;Elite schools unanimously believe that the economic future of nations lies in the capacity of their youth to be able to .violet[exploit] 利用 global opportunities and that schools need to align curriculum reform to the emerging requirements of the global economy. Schools are expected to .violet[produce citizens who understand the global system]. (Kenway et al., 2017, p. 148)

### Globalization: no point of imitating others

&gt;Each school appears to want to become exemplary 表率 in the fast globalizing, or in some cases, regionalizing, market of elite schools. 
&gt;
&gt;Each seeks to offer curriculum options aimed at .violet[producing a global imagination in students and the ability to exploit the opportunities provided by the global economy and transnational cultural connectivities]. (Kenway et al., 2017, p. 148)

## David Labaree distinguishes dual values of education
### .orange[Use value] 使用價值: 
the content of what is learned in schools as intrinsically useful
- Knowledge and skills
- Morale values
- Socialization with peers

&gt;To provide students with a useful array of competencies that are required for constructive citizenship in a democratic society or for productive work in a market society&lt;sup&gt;.red[2]&lt;/sup&gt;.

### .orange[Exchange value] 交換價值
the primary aim of education is .violet[to exchange one's education for something more substantial]: a job or social status, which provides the holder with a comfortable standard of living, financial security, social power, and cultural prestige.

## What did elite schools offer?

High quality education? Maybe, but definitely not reflected in the high school fees. 

.red[__A global token of prestige__] (i.e. very high exchange values):
- Differentiation ("I am the one and only")
- Social network ("Who you know is more important than what you know")

.red[__Cultural, symbolic usage__] 象征性的用途 :
- Make students familiar with accepted ways of interacting among same-class

---

## Education plays multiple roles

Historian David Labaree argues that three functions of schooling:
- Democratic equality
- Social efficiency
- Social mobility



### Democratic equality
School should focus on preparing citizens:
- Citizenship training (morals, values, behavior, etc)
- Equal treatment
- Equal access

---

### Social efficiency
Our economic well-being depends on our ability to prepare the young to carry out useful economic roles with competence:
- Vocationalism 職業屬性 (i.e. prepare people to get a job)
- Educational stratification 社會通過教育分層 (i.e. channeling people to different destination of the job market)
- Improve human capital of the entire society

.green[Think why governments around the world buy into PISA? Economic efficiency is the underlying reason.]

---

### Social mobility
Education is a .violet[commodity] 商品, the only purpose of which is to provide individual students with a .violet[competitive advantage] in the struggle for desire able social positions
- Individual status attainment 幫助個人獲取功名
- Selective &amp; differential 有選擇性和區分性的
- Stratification 社會分層 (i.e. consumers want their product to be different)
    + graded hierarchy (A, A-, B+, ...)
    + qualitative differences between institutions at each level (i.e. school ranking, banding, reputation)
    + stratified structure of opportunities within each institution (i.e. advanced class vs. normal class)

---

## Whose education are these goals representing?

Stakeholders 利益相關者:
- the Nation
- Business community
- Individual students and parents
- Social groups (religious group, 社团)

### Having various stakeholders in the education enterprise means: (1) support from different walks of life; (2) educational goals are not always harmonious

For instance, democratic equality vs. social efficiency are contradictory in many ways.

---

## What role does schools play?
Sociologists have an ongoing debate: .orange[What role does education play in shaping individual student's chance of moving up and down the social mobility ladder? ]教育研究中長久以來的爭論：學校對於學生的社會流動扮演什麽角色?

&gt;Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the .orange[great equalizer] of the conditions of men, the balance-wheel of the social machinery. -- Horace Mann, _Twelfth annual report to the Massachusetts State Board of Education_, 1848

Most advocates for public education hold this belief that education will equalize the chance for students. .green[But the irony is, people want social class, especially want their own children to be different from others.] 

The more democratic education is, the more elite (differentiation, stratification, scarcity) people seek in other realms.

---

## .red[Summary]

Jane Kenway calls elite schools .orange[class choreographer] &lt;sup&gt;.red[3]&lt;/sup&gt;
- The formation of social class is not static 靜態, but in perpetual motion.
- But there is some structural forces behind the making of social class (e.g. just like the role of the invisible choreographer in a dance).
- Elite social class is about .orange[dominance] 支配 over the rest of the society. But it is subtle.
- Elite school is where its students learn to articulate their dominance.

### Elite schooling as an example of how education is used by high social class to maintain its edge over the rest of the society.
