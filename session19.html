## Nature of competitive schooling
![](./pic/shadow1.png)


---

## The "Shadow" metaphor
Shadow education is essentially more education. But there are several key characteristics:


.orange[Supplementation] 補充: more education on top of common school experience


.orange[Privateness] 私有: tutoring provided by private entrepreneurs and individuals for profit-making purposes.


.orange[Academic] 學術性質: language subjects, mathematics, and other examinable subjects. 

---

## Shadow is almost everywhere

In .violet[Hong Kong], a 2011/12 survey found that 53.8% of G9 students and 71.8% of G12 students were receiving private supplementary tutoring &lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.

--

In .violet[India], a 2012 survey indicated that 73% of children aged 6-14 were receiving tutoring.

--

In .violet[Kazakhstan], a 2005/06 survey of university students found 59.9% had receive tutoring during their last year of secondary school.

--

In .violet[Vietnam], 2006 survey indicated 32% of primary students, 46% of lower secondary, and 63% of upper secondary students received tutoring.

## Shadow is almost everywhere

More detailed data from .violet[Singapore]:
- 60% of high school, and 80% of primary school age students receive private tuition.


- 40% of pre-schoolers receive private tuition.


- Pre-schoolers, on average, attend two hours private tuition per week, while primary school aged children are attending, on average, at least three hours per week.


- According to Singapore's Household Expenditure Survey, private tuition in Singapore is a SGD 1.1 billion dollar industry almost double the amount households spent in 2005 (SGD 650 million).

## Negative consequences: student suicide

---

## Negative consequences: Mental illness

When children are being asked to achieve perfection in every level, their minds some times could not adapt very well &lt;sup&gt;.red[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

--

- When parents are highly intrusive 高度介入 and controlling, children are more likely to be .violet[self-critical] 自我批評, .violet[anxious] 焦慮, and .violet[depression] 憂鬱.

- Intrusiveness also indicates to children that they are not good enough and that parents have to intervene in various domains of their lives. 

- As a consequence, these children might become .violet[overly concerned] about committing even the slightest errors.

## Broad implications

Impact on citizenship: societies divided along socioeconomic line (those who can and cannot afford more education at private expense)

--

Education becomes a .red[commodity]:

- A goods for sale

- Students/parents are consumers and schools are service providers

- Differentiating learning experiences

--

Create a "losing culture": Only tiny fraction of successful winners but a large army of failed ones.

--

Skew motivation for learning

# Why people want _more_ education?

---

## If it is so bad, why people still want it?

Scholar Clark Sorensen pointed out: &lt;sup&gt;.red[3]&lt;/sup&gt;
- Unique parent-child relationship in Asia: parents expected to be cared for by their children in old age and .violet[filial piety] 孝道 by giving them a good funeral, worship them after death, is core of Korean ethics.

--

- Reciprocal dependence 相互依賴: parents invest in children and expect payback in old age

- Family's social status depends on children's academic/economic success

## The cultural explanation 文化解釋

This leads to the very unique Asian family culture:

- Parents are more likely to .violet[interfere] 干預 with children's learning and social choices rather than respect children's own will.

--

- Parents have the time, and inclination, and the power to .violet[demand] that their children succeed in school. 

--

- Inside schools, teachers request .violet[respect] 尊敬 and .violet[compliance] 順從 from students while convincing them that they care about them as human beings and have their best interests at heart.

--

- .orange[It is the effort, not ability that matters to the parents and family]

## However, culture alone couldn't explain the zeal people have on education
## It requires a powerful modern ally: .red[Social mobility for the individual]

## The sociological explanation 社會學解釋

Sociologist Ralph Tuner proposed two types of social mobility 社會流動:

--

- .orange[Contest mobility] 競爭流動模式 is like a sporting event in which many compete for a few recognized prizes. Applied to mobility, the contest norms means that victory by a person of moderate intelligence accomplished through the use of .violet[common sense, enterprise, daring, and successful risk-taking] is more appreciated than victory by .violet[the most intelligent] or .violet[the best educated].

--

- .orange[Sponsored mobility] 庇護流動模式 ejects the pattern of the contest and favors a .violet[controlled] selection process. 

--
	+ In this process the elite or their agents, deem to be the best qualified to judge merit, choose individuals for elite status who have .violet[the appropriate qualities]. 
	+ Individual do not win or seize elite status; mobility is rather .violet[a process of sponsored induction to the elite].

---

## Rising idea of .green[meritocracy]

Sponsored mobility model is closely linked with .green[meritocracy] 賢能主義/唯才主義, an idea that power/opportunity should be allocated based on ability and talent:


- National elites design tests to select future talents


- Selective tests are considered most fair for all

--

Meritocracy is deeply rooted in Confucianism 儒家. Confucius himself cared deeply about how to design a system to pick the best suited to serve the country &lt;sup&gt;.red[4]&lt;/sup&gt;:
- This idea operates at societal level.


- It requires every participants to do whatever they can to gain an competitive edge in a society where the State controls most of the resources.

## When combining with close-knit family culture

Your family's glory/destiny is tied to children's, as a result, families tend to .violet[_push_] the children very hard. 

Goes hand-in-hand: families also tend to invest tremendous amount of resources in their children.

At societal level, your social status is largely defined by: 1) the types of education received; 2) the relative status within each institution/department/major.

Your merit is judged by: .cyan[talent; GPA; internship; study abroad; awards, etc]. All these things are some versions of .violet[_competition_].

The competition is smallest at lower ranking institutions, but intensifies at the top of each level.

# The shadow of education is really a consequence when education becomes universal &amp; global.

---

# .red[Summary]

Modern day competitive schooling is deeply rooted in culture, social relationships, and philosophy about individual &amp; society.


The shadow continues to grow: In a "school-ed society" (David Baker, Session 11), we are likely to see the spread of such education fever around the world.


Is there a way out? It is possibly outside the education system itself.
