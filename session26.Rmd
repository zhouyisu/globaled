# Learning without boarders 
## Aims

To identify limitation of traditional learning

To articulate why schools are reluctant to change

To understand how new forms of learning is transforming education

---

## To recap

Last Thursday we talked about university as a global institution with goals of producing and spreading knowledge. 

--

In order to achieve this goal, as well as nurturing a particular type of young talent: .violet[those who have built-in capacities and interests to understand all aspects of social and natural reality], we also needs a new kind of pedagogy.

--

But in reality, only a handful of institutions are teaching in such a way. In many places, teaching & learning remain largely the same as those in secondary schools.

???

I for one, was quite dreadful of the university experience I receive. The professors I encountered seems less interested to connects or even talk to me than finishing up his lectures.

---

## The form of teaching & learning

Let us be reminded what classroom teaching is back in 1999

### Similarity of teaching & learning across the world
What does teaching & learning have in common?

- Classroom
- Lecture
- Textbook
- Homework

--

Assumptions of teaching & learning:

- The structure of knowledge is linear 知識結構的線性
- The structure of classroom is conformative 課堂組織結構的一致性


???

The worst part maybe: to acquire knowledge is simply transmit it from one place (the instructor) to another (the student). As I saw a couple of weeks ago on mid-term exam paper on the desk of this classroom.

I always wonder if this is a glorified version of the actual teaching. No one fell asleep?

## Questions yet to be answered

.orange[Is this model of teaching & learning effective?]

- Does it improve learning efficiency? 提升學習效率嗎？
- Does it improve learning motivation? 是否促進學習的動力？
- Does it improve student ability? 是否促進學生的能力？

## Modern schooling: bring education to the mass

Education is primary domestic policy. In this regard, I appreciate the impact PISA brought to our current school system because if you wait for the happen from within, it might take a long period of time.

University is supposed to be this trailblazer that brings changes. But again, university is largely walled-off from elementary and secondary schools. Such that the change impact could be directly transmitted.

## Changing the format: failed attempt (1)

## Failed attempt (2): replace textbooks with laptop

![](https://gdurl.com/bFsx)

---
class: middle

##The format of teaching & learning is stubbornly reluctant to change, because they are:

- Cheap to implement
- Socially accepted
- Results are difficult to measure
- Produce predictable token: credential (i.e. degrees)

---

## Changes came from outside of school

![](http://fundacionunam.org.mx/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/salaman_khan_1.jpg)

## Salman Khan's idea

He worked in a hedge fund in 2004 as an analyst. He was tutoring his cousins at home after work. He found the instruction repetitive and not efficient:

- Record his lecture as video and upload to youtube.
- Write a computer program to generate test questions.

---

## His approach to the same math class

.pull-right[
Features:
- Each video 5-15 minutes long
- Use colors to highlight key points
- Self-paced
- Can interact with others in comment section

### Why not expand to other subjects?

???

45 minutes lecture is actually 12 minute long. Stuffed with many different things in school.

## Khan's curriculum was used by millions for different purposes

## Khan's success brings us to think

Traditional learning is ".cyan[one-size-fits-all]" and .cyan[discipline-based]:

- Content is not differentiated 教學內容無法因人而異
- Teaching style is not individualized 教學方法無法個性化
- Pace is the same for all students 課堂進度是一致不變的
- Classroom time is limited and fixed 課堂時間有限

--

This standardization in traditional learning also produces:

- Compulsory course
- Inflexible behavioral regulations
- Rigid tracking systems,
- Rituals
- Public ranking of performance
- Humiliation of failure to conform

---

## Traditional learning is created & accepted by the society at a specific time

- Technology is limited
	+ Could not deliver high-quality contents to millions at once
	+ No way to give feedbacks or diagnoses learning progress
- Amount of people who can receive an education is limited
- Type of knowledge we want to teach is limited

---

## Then, Universities were involved

One thing university is good at: there is no shortage of pioneers

## What is different this time?

Combined these programs are called .red[M]assive .red[O]pen .red[O]nline .red[C]ourse (.red[MOOC] or 慕課 in Chinese)

__Characteristics:__

- Free (or at least very cheap) 免費或非常廉價
- Wide-range of topics (anything you want to learn) 囊括大量的知識
- Can be taken by large number of students at the same time 允許大量學生同時上課 
- Delivered by top professors in the field (high quality) 由最好的教授講解
- Organized content 課程內容有序

This type of new learning uses some of the latest .orange[learning theory]:

- .violet[Active learning] 積極學習 through video and interactive exercise
- .violet[Gamification] 遊戲化: the use of game thinking and game mechanisms in non-gaming contexts to engage users in solving problems and increase users' self-contribution.
- .violet[Self pacing] 自主掌控學習進度
- .violet[Instant feedback] 實時反饋
- .violet[Peer-learning] 同學互助

## MOOC is not the silver bullet, because it...
.violet[Could not replace schools & universities]:

- It couldn't solve the motivation problem.
- It couldn't solve the social problem (i.e. poverty, social class, etc)
- It couldn't solve ethical problem (i.e. cheating, etc)
- It didn't change the fact that learning is an extremely sophisticated human behavior 
    
--

.violet[Not all subjects are suitable]:

- Location dependent knowledge (e.g. globalization)
- Subjective knowledge (e.g. history)
- Knowledge outside of English

---
class: reverse, center, middle

## If MOOC has so much limitation, why is it still important?

---

## Reason 1
Because it has .cyan[democratized learning]:

- As learners, we can learn almost anything without physically moving to another country
- Competition of providing the best content has been leveled to the global level
- Has the potential to break the monopoly of .violet[elite schools & universities]
	+ In fact, some elite universities are pioneers in reducing the barriers of people getting an equivalent university education

???

In a way, MOOC forges a global learning community

---

## Reason 2 Higher education has changed

![](https://gdurl.com/t1IH)

The token value of a higher education degree is associated with the scarcity of supplies. With more people holding the degree, the exchange value diminishes greatly.

---

### Think Macao is an exception?

Net enrollment rate for Macao's youth at higher education? .red[98%].

![](https://gdurl.com/5gzE)

There is increasingly not meaningful or even feasible to stacking up degrees. So online degree/learning stabs at the credentialism with unique use value.

---
## .red[Summary]
New forms of learning has brought walled-off 被牆隔開 knowledge to learners.

It is still up to the learner to harness the benefit.

Schools & universities will not be replace overnight because they are as much a .violet[social institution] as a learning institution.

Universities are at the center of this change both because of its mission (.violet[to create and disseminate] 傳播 knowledge) and changing student body.
