# Useful metaphors

--

### 1. .red[Solids] 固態
- People, things, information, and places "harden" over time and therefore have limited mobility.

--

### 2. .red[Liquidity] 液態
- Increasing ease of movement of people, things, information, and places in the globe.

--

### 3. .red[Gaseousness] 氣態 
- Hyper-mobility of people, things, information, and places in the global age. 

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# All That Is Solid Melts into Air. 一切固定的東西都煙消雲散了。

---
## Global flows

Karl Marx said it in the .orange[_Communist Manifesto_] (1848).

--

Today we use this metaphor to describe globalization: from solids to liquids to gases
- become lighter 輕盈
- move faster
- doesn't have a concrete form 沒有實在的形態

--

Includes the movement of:
- .violet[people]: migrants
- .violet[things]: materials and goods
- .violet[information]: data of all sorts
- .violet[places]: all kinds of "clone" towns in China
- .violet[identity] 身份


---
### Example: The ways we make things become more "fluid"

---

## Who is using it?

--
- .orange[Print on demand] (隨需列印) by Amazon.com
- .orange[Just in Time] (即時化生產) by Zara and Uniqlo

---
### Print on demand: It doesn't matter if a publisher drops you

### What makes Weir's novel a success?

--
Globalization can harness the power of the long tail.

]

---

### A large number of small consumers (i.e. the long tail) who are connected by a universal platform

--
A self-publishing model that keeps writer motivated:
- Doesn't require book publisher to stock up physical books.
- Significantly reduce the cost of getting book published.

--

This model also has a Chinese version: .cyan[起點中文網] (https://www.qidian.com/)

---

### Zara &amp; Uniqlo's supply chain 供應鏈
![](./pic/zara.jpg)

---
### What makes Zara &amp; Uniqlo a success?

.yellow[low cost &amp; variety of products]

--

Why is it possible?
- Global logistic network 全球物流網絡
- Information processing capabilities to track consumer demand and inventory almost real-time 信息處理技術
- Light on inventory (e.g. they don't stock on final product. Instead, only fabrics and materials) 零庫存

---

## What is the implication? (people, things, information, places...)

For many modern business, globalization enables them to:
- .orange[Get rid of the solids]: less inventory, less warehouses, less labor needed

--
- .orange[Disruptive innovation] 破壞性創新: traditional book publishers are dying; department stores are dying; new business model requires different manufacturing process

--
- Create a process of .orange[centralization &amp; decentralization] (中心化和去中心化): New centers arises and old centers destroyed

--
- .orange[Demand new type of skills and knowledge] from the participants (more of that next week):
	+ information processing
	+ optimization
    + financial models
    + operation
    + product creation

# Metaphors
### 4. .red[Flows]:
- .green[Interconnected flows]: e.g. global fishing industry (fish + ship fleet + flow of cheap labor + processing destinations)
- .green[Multidirectional flows]: e.g. information flow (positive &amp; negative simultaneously)
- .green[Conflicting flows]: e.g. global "war on terror" and global terrorist networks
- .green[Reverse flows]: e.g. air pollution pushed from one country to another

---
# Metaphors
### 5. .red[Barriers]:
- .green[Material structures]: e.g. border controls 邊境管制

--
- .green[Deliberate blocks]: e.g. government prevention of foreign ownership; censorship of information

--
- .green[Subtler structural barriers]: e.g. disadvantaged – poor, minorities, gender, etc.

.violet[Barriers are __created__, can change, and do not impact people evenly].

--
### 6. .red[Structures]: set of processes that may either _impede_ or _block_ flows or to serve _expedite_ and _channel_ them.
- e.g. global financial structure

---
## Going back to iPhone/Apple example

--
What are the solids/liquid/gas?

--
- Apple does not hire all these workers at the assembly line. They are all outsourced 外包/外判 to contractor.

--
- Apple constantly changes iPhone's technology so it wants ".cyan[flexibility]".

--
- Apple build its product by large numbers, so it want ".cyan[scale up]" really quickly.

--
### Questions

What is flexibility? 
What is scale up? 
Can you explain?

---

### What are the flows?
- Financial flow?
- Hard materials?
- Information?

--

### What are the barrier?
- Import taxes (in recent trade war between US-China, Apple fear the iPhone will be taxed)
- Labor regulation (how many hours should a worker work)
- Government censorship on information (where is your iCloud data stored?)
- Consumer taste differences (Rose gold?)

---
class: middle, center

# These are great things for consumers. But are they inevitable?

---

The often-repeated rhetoric that globalization (the process) leads to more globalization (the condition) .violet[does not] allow us to draw meaningful analytical distinctions between causes and effects

--

Even we can pretty much all agree that we live in a globalized age, we can still find examples of angry people shouting .violet[no more globalization].

# The great globalization debate

--

.red[Globalists] 支持全球主義者 – believe that there is such a thing as globalization and that it encompasses virtually the entire globe.

--

.red[Skeptics] 懷疑論者 – believe that there is no such thing as globalization, that it is an over-simplification of complex processes.

---

## Globalists' view

Majority of world enmeshed in globalization, both as a general process and as multiple globalizations.

.violet[Nation-state] (民族國家) being supplanted as main actor, with .violet[multilateralism] (多邊主義) emphasized.

Multi-layered global governance.

Transnational economy of MNCs (.violet[Multi National Cooperations]) and global division of labor.

The rise of global popular culture and decline of fixed political identities.

---

## Skeptics' view

No one process of globalization but many (not all are positive, some brings damages to the society).

Nation-state still vital and reasserting itself, with inter-governmentalism emphasized.

Global order still through international order of nation-states.

National economies still central and few true MNCs.

Global culture thesis exaggerated/declined, national and regional cultures reasserted.

---

## Question: Why is it the case?

Because globalization is .violet[uneven]:
- Some people gain more than others
- Intractable harms could be done
- Can cause rippling political/socioeconomic consequences

--

.green[_Can you think of any examples? or elaborate on previous cases?_]


---
## Globalization is a process

Because there are backlashes and push-backs, Globalization is not a one-way street (e.g. globalization leads to more globalization). Manfred Steger believes:

--
- We should not assume that globality is already upon us

--
- Nor does the term suggest a determinate endpoint that precludes any further development

--

Instead, we should .violet[be able to imagine different social manifestations of globality]: one might be based primarily on values of individualism, competition, and laissez-faire capitalism, while another might draw on more communal norms and cooperative social systems. (more on this in later weeks)


---
## If we are already global, are we still national or local?

--
![](https://www.racctrusted.com/ebay/img/tony-chiu-wai-leung-autograph-signed-8x10-photo-racc-trusted-372218597622.jpg)

---
## If we are already global, are we still national or local?

--
It is not to say that national and local communal frameworks have lost their power to provide people with a meaningful sense of home and identity. 

--

The weakening/strengthening of the national imaginary, ironically, could take place at the same time.
- The .violet[intensification of global consciousness] destabilizes and unsettles the nation-state framework within which people have .yellow[imagined] their communal existence.

--
- On the other hand, the conflict and senses of urgency raised by globalization make us feel .yellow[more connected] with people around us

--

In fact, the national and local are changing their character and social functions as a result of our movement towards globality. At its core, globalization is about .violet[shifting forms of human contact].

---
## What role does education play in globalization?

Education as a means to increase economic competitiveness.

--

Education as a safeguard to defend local/national identity.

--

Education as a process to facilitate global flow.

--

Education as a critical approach to question globalization.


---
# .red[Summary]

.violet[Key characteristics of globalization:] Notice that the conceptualization of globalization as a .orange[dynamic process] rather than as a static condition forces global studies scholar to pay close attention to new forms of connectivity and integration.

--

Think of the flow: it never cease to stop or being still.

---
## Some key characteristics
.violet[Key characteristics:] Intensification and acceleration of social exchanges and activities. It involves both the .green[creation] of new social networks and the .green[multiplication] of existing connections that cut across traditional political, economic, cultural, and geographical boundaries.

Remember: `\(1 + 1 &gt; 2\)` in many cases

---
## Some key characteristics
.violet[Key characteristics:] Another quality of globalization is reflected in the .green[expansion] and the .green[stretching] of social relations, activities, and connections. 

Example: How many of "friends" do you have on Facebook or WeChat?

--

.violet[Key characteristics:] globalization involves the .green[intensification] and .green[acceleration] of social exchange and activities.

---
## Some key characteristics

.violet[Key characteristics:] globalization processes do not occur merely on an objective, material level but they also involve the subjective plane of .green[human consciousness]. Without erasing local and national attachments, the compression of the world into a single place has increasingly made global the frame of reference for human thought and action. Hence, globalization involves both the macro-structures of a 'global' community and the micro-structures of 'global personhood'.
