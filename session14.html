# Global inequality
## Aims

1. How does globalization affect the top 1%?

2. What might be the causes and consequences for the rest of us?

## Global inequality is .brown[both] rising and falling, depending on where you look

Branko Milanovic writes&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt;:
&gt;And although our data for the past are quite tentative and in some cases not much better than guesses, .violet[it is still the first time since 1820 that global inequality is deemed to have gone down, from approximately 69 Gini points to around 64]. (On the Gini scale, 100 would be complete inequality while 0 would be complete equality).

However, another somewhat paradoxical pattern also exists:
&gt;In most countries, and especially in the big ones like China, India, the United States, and Russia, .violet[national inequalities have risen].

## The global super rich (top 1% and 0.1%) reaped unproportional benefits from globalization and economic growth, and

### 1) there is no sign of them slowing down
### 2) there (maybe) less and less a chance the rest could catch up

---

## How did the global top 1% achieve that?

The super rich are called ".red[plutocrats]" and the situation we are facing today is called .red[plutocracy] (金權政治): a society that is ruled or controlled by people of great wealth

 What drives their success? Social scientists came up with two explanations:

__Political factors:__
- Lower taxes for the rich
- Deregulation of certain industries (i.e. make it easy for business to enter; less rules)
- Financialization of everything (i.e. no matter what the phyisical product is, people can build financial products on top of it)
- Privatization
- Weaker protection for labor unions

People called such political influence .red[crony capitalism] 裙帶資本主義, in which .green["businesses thrive not as a result of risk, but rather as a return on money amassed through a nexus between a business class and the political class."] (via wikipedia)

---

## A similar saying in Chinese: .violet[識做人緊要過識讀書] 
### (aka "what matters is who you know, not what you know")

Political changes benefit a group of .green[insiders] who are well connected that don't do much good for the rest of the little guys.

It is very hard to get rid of crony capitalism. Not single country, nor companies (some even have a motto called: "don't do evil") can say they did that:

## But at least, intellectually, we can pretty much agree that such thing is bad for us all. 

Crony capitalism is often associated with corruption and corruption is bad for the society

### Therefore throughout the political spectrum, both the left and the right seem both hate it

## But people's attitude is much varying when we look at the second explanation: .violet[Globalization] + .violet[Technology revolution]

---

### Why? Because they are two sides of a single coin.

According to Canada's Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland: &lt;sup&gt;.red[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

&gt; Globalization and the technology revolution, the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy, are also powering the rise of the super rich.

### Globalization &amp; technology revolution brought economic growth for many .violet[at the same time] award much much more to the small handful. They polarize 兩極分化 our world:
For the first time in human history, any entrepreneurs could quickly:
- Access to a unified market with at least 1 billion consumers
- Access to capital market across countries (i.e. Hong Kong, New York, Shanghai, etc)

## What's wrong about being super good at doing something?

Chrystia Freeland lays out 3 implications:
1. Meritocratic plutocracy can become .red[crony capitalism]
	+ meritoratic: one's achievement is based on talent or effort. Chinese translation would be 唯才是用 or 選賢舉能 
	+ It will be very tempting to "change the game" (i.e. manipulate the social/political process) in your favor.

2. Meritocratic plutocracy can become .red[aristocracy] 世襲制
	+ How today's middle &amp; upper class spent crazy amount of money on their children for the important skills that make them successful
	+ It is what at top that matters: Harvard, Stanford and MIT

3. Globalization also .red[hollowing out] 空心化 the middle class in Western industrialized economics. 
	+ Outsourcing
	+ Technology replacing human labor (i.e. deskilling)

### Will the elites block the social mobility ladder once they are up there?

### The consequence of inequality: The higher the equality, the lower the social mobility

_The Great Gatsby curve_ by Alan Krueger: it describes the relationship between inequality and generational earnings mobility.

## What about the rest of us? Individual labor is losing out (on average)

[According to IMF](https://blogs.imf.org/2017/04/12/drivers-of-declining-labor-share-of-income/): 

&gt;"Labor’s share of income declines when wages grow more slowly than productivity, or the amount of output per hour of work. .violet[The result is that a growing fraction of productivity gains has been going to capital.] And since capital tends to be concentrated in the upper ends of the income distribution, falling labor income shares are likely to raise income inequality."


In short: __it is easier to make more money when you have money__.

### "A fantastic montage of the globalized good life, and a tale of star-crossed lovers recast in the imperium of modern Asia, where everything is so beguilingly glamorous that not even its own inhabitants can believe their own good luck. It is, intentionally, too good to be true, because the subculture of Asia's ultra-rich is alien to most Asians and non-Asians alike."

Intentionally apolitical, fairy tale.
